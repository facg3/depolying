 Cloud Computing is where software application, data storage and processing capacity are accessed over the internet.

 There are three ways to cloud compute. 
   - SaaS: Software as a service.
   - PaaS: Platform as a service.
   - Iaas : Infrastructure as service.


All of these allow users to run applications or store data online. However, each offers a different level of user flexibility and control.



## What is PaaS?
Specifically, PaaS allows users to create their own cloud applications using supplier specific tools and languages.

 PaaS provides an environment and a set of tools that allow users to create their new online applications.
 

## What services are there that can provide you with a platform for your code? And Why is it useful to be able to deploy your code to a cloud platform, rather than running it locally?


There are many devices that ann help.For example, Google has a product called App Engine that allows useers to develop, run and maintain their own web applicstions on Google's Infrastructure. 


Microsoft also has a PaaS offering called "Azure" which allows users to develop and run windows applications in Microsoft applications in Microsoft's region of the Cloud.

Salesforce is also a big player on the past landscape with an offering called "force.com".

Both Google App Engine and force.com currently allow an application to be built and hosted for free.
